## Project Overview

This project was conducted to help Grammy's Digital strategy Team determine the impact of the splitting of both of their websites (Grammys and Recording Academy) as well as analyzing the trend and patterns of visitors to those websites. Another analysis focus is to compare the data of a competitor (AMA) with the data collected by the Grammys.

Using Python and various data analysis libraries (Pandas, Numpy, Plotly), the project includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualizations to uncover insights about the Grammy Awards' history

## Objectives

- Examine the impact of splitting the two websites (Grammys and Recording Academy)
- Analyze the data to better understand trends and audience behavior on both sites
- Provide insights and visualizations to inform the Grammys Digital Strategy Team
